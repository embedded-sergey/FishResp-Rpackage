Title: Analytical Tool for Aquatic Respirometry
Description: Calculates metabolic rate of fish and other aquatic organisms measured using
             an intermittent-flow respirometry approach. The tool is used to run a set of graphical
             QC tests of raw respirometry data, correct it for background respiration and chamber
             effect, filter and extract target values of absolute and mass-specific metabolic rate.
             Experimental design should include background respiration tests and measuring of one
             or more metabolic rate traits. The R package is ideally integrated with the pump
             controller 'PumpResp' and the DO meter 'SensResp' (open-source hardware by FishResp).
             Raw respirometry data can be also imported from 'AquaResp' (free software), 'AutoResp'
             ('LoligoSystems'), 'OxyView' ('PreSens'), 'Pyro Oxygen Logger' ('PyroScience') and
             'Q-box Aqua' ('QubitSystems').
